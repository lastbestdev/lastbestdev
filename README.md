## hello 😃

my name is Brad, and i live in Montana. (yes, it exists) ⛰️🤠

### quickly
i wrote my first line of code in community college back in 2018, and fell in love instantly. our final class project was programming an [arduino sumo robot](https://www.pololu.com/product/2510) (sweet). i completed my 2 years there, and decided to take a year off.

during that time, i remember driving to the local library to mooch wifi (my place didn't have any) and learn about web development. this was typically when i got off from my full time job, working 10 hour days in a warehouse ($10/hr btw). the library was always closed by then, so i'd just sit in the parking lot in my car and learn! 

(yeah i'm forklift certified, nbd.)

### the gist
from day 1, i've been fascinated by the ability to "build things" with nothing but my brain, a laptop, and an internet connection (sometimes). that interest is every bit intact today!
